<h2>Fintech — Appsolute Bankfurt</h2>
</div>
<div class='content text'>
<p class='highlight1'></p>
<p><p><em>This is a translation of my article <a href="fintech-bankfurt-geht-app.html" target="_blank">“Fintech — Frankfurt geht App”</a>.</em></p>

<p>Who thought they might have found a pun in the headline is mistaking: 2015 has been the year in which the term fintech became a thing in Frankfurt. On nearly every networking event you would hear about innovative—or even better <a href="https://www.google.de/trends/explore#q=%22fintech+startups%22" target="_blank">disruptive</a>—business ideas: startups that somehow work with money. But what is fintech and why does Frankfurt seem to be the center of the scene around this topic—given <a href="http://www.wsj.de/nachrichten/SB11035627169406564433404580202153236668526" target="_blank">you believe local actors</a>?</p>

<h2><em>Fintech</em> — digital financial services</h2>

<p>The term summarizes the usage of information technology—which is in a broad sense software—to be employed for delivering financial services. Applied <em>fintech</em> can be the display of your account balance in an iPhone app, the automatization of an investment strategy with <em>robo advisors</em>—software which automatically buys and sells according to predefined rules in order to reach the goal of the strategy—or the statistical analysis of account transactions to understand your customers better. Where this has been done in the past by the banks themselves the last two years have seen a rise of enterprises outside of banks that aim to get a piece of the huge cake known as the financial market. This development has been fed by the digitalization of all bank process which started back in the 1980s and 1990s and realizes all processes inside a bank via software which by today is heavily outdated and requires huge efforts to adapt to the latest customer needs. This opens up the opportunity to develop software as some kind of external extension which is able to be better at doing things compared to the software of the banks. And this isn’t limited to classic bank processes: transferring money between two email addresses is <em>fintech</em> and offering vendor-neutral insurances—something banks have always struggled with in the past—is, too.</p>

<p>Being fully digital another charming characteristic of this market is that the initial investments needed for developing new products is low: compared to the establishment of a national supermarket chain an europe-wide app launch requires only few capital and has nearly zero costs for additional customers. Combined with the omnipresent demand for financial services this creates the opportunity for huge profits if ideas succeed. Digital services can now be delivered to all important and financially strong customer segments because in the recent years the acceptance of tablets and smartphones has penetrated every age group. Therefore the prospect for the success of a fintech startup is very good and given the current period of low interest rates combined with the prevailing economic boom financial investors have turned to venture capital—giving money to fund the the incorporation of organizations that have the potential to return a multitude of the invested capital at a later exit. Compared to the low interest rates for fixed-term deposits of around 1% per year which results in a negative interest rate if the inflation is considered a rate of 300% after 5 years sounds much more interesting. After roughly two years we can’t say today how the sector with <a href="https://www.mindmeister.com/de/488176466/fintech-landscape" target="_blank">more than 500 startups</a> will develop in the long-term—there is basically no profitable startup today and with only two IPOs (<a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3ALC" target="_blank">Lending Club</a> and <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NYSE%3AONDK" target="_blank">On Deck</a>) there is simply not enough data to predict whether fintechs will survive the banks which is what many of them are boasting themselves to achieve.</p>

<p>With much fanfare customers startups offered better, more individual, and smarter products while playing the death march for the big banks. What is often underestimated is the fact that banks are part of our German culture: the German is an eager saver and brands like Sparkasse, Deutsche Bank and DiBa are well established. These institutes can—more or less—claim the trust of their customers and have another ace up their sleeves: a banking license which alone <a href="http://www.welt.de/finanzen/article138894620/Das-aberwitzige-Abenteuer-eine-Bank-zu-gruenden.html" target="_blank">costs around 700,000 €</a> not including the costs for the staff required to operate a banking business according the attached regulations. This is simply too much to handle even for a well funded startup; therefore they are forced to cooperate with banks which re-introduces the old and slothy bank processes back into their own innovative product.</p>

<p>The organisational efforts required to negotiate a partnership with a bank is one of the many things that pose a serious problem for startups. Time is of essence in the quickly moving fintech market. Startup funders usually expect an exit—usually an IPO or a sale of the company—after 3 to 5 years. During this short timeframe startups must prove that they are able to attract enough customers and become profitable. But customers are increasingly sceptical in face of an ever increasing offering of new products and especially the German customers are notoriously known for their slow acceptance of “new things” when it comes to hard earned money. For years they have learned where the money belongs: in the bank. Fintechs thus not only face internal problems but fight an uphill battle for the attention of their target group.</p>

<p>Last but not least the idea to provide better financial services through software has an inherent problem: it can only be applied to processes that can be automated. Organizations can profit from software the most if they are able to cater many customers with similar needs. If your target group is too small your profit won’t be big enough given the required efforts mentioned above. But if you target a mass market your average customer won’t have big budgets at their hands which results in a low average margin per customer. It is therefore very hard to find a good fit between product, customer and point in time. Because this is not an exact science I am sceptical regarding the success of many fintechs. And finally it is hard to patent software which enables banks to just sit and wait for successful products to emerge and copy them for their own needs—the bill will be paid by the venture capitalists and the many founders and employees that once came to change the world.</p>
